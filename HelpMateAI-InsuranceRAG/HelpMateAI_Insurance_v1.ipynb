A change in the Scheduled Benefits because of a request by the Member when a change in family status has occurred for which Proof of Good Health is not required (see e. above) will normally be effective on the date of the request. However, if the Member is not Actively at Work on the date a Scheduled Benefit change would otherwise be effective, the Scheduled Benefit change will not be in force until the date the Member returns to Active Work. Any decrease in Scheduled Benefit amounts due to a request by the Member will be effective on the date of the change, whether or not the Member is Actively at Work. A change in the Scheduled Benefits because of a request by the Member when a change in family status has occurred for which Proof of Good Health is required (see e. above) will be effective on the later of: (1) the date the change would have been effective if Proof of Good Health had not been required; or (2) the date Proof of Good Health is approved by The Principal.

Article 3 - Dependent Life Insurance Dependent Life Insurance is available only with respect to Dependents of Members currently insured for Member Life Insurance. If a Member is eligible for Dependent Life Insurance, such insurance will be effective under the same terms as set forth for Member Life Insurance in this Section B, Article 1, except as described below.

A Member's adopted child, if that child meets the requirements in a. above and the Member: (1) is a party in a law suit in which the Member is seeking the adoption of the child; or (2) has custody of the child under a court order that grants custody of the child to the Member. An adopted child will be considered a Dependent Child on the earlier of: the date the petition for adoption is filed; or the date of entry of an order granting the adoptive parent custody of the child for the purpose of adoption. d. A Civil Union Partner's child who otherwise qualifies above or if the Member or Civil Union Partner has been appointed the child's guardian under a valid court order. Developmental Disability A Dependent Child's substantial handicap, as determined by The Principal, which: a. results from mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, or other neurological disorder; and b. is diagnosed by a Physician as a permanent or long-term continuing condition. Full-Time Student A Member's Dependent Child attending a school that has a regular teaching staff, curriculum, and student body and who: a. attends school on a full-time basis, as determined by the school's criteria; and b. is dependent on the Member for principal support.

In no event will Dependent Life Insurance be in force for a Member who is not insured for Member Life Insurance. b. If a Dependent spouse is in a Period of Limited Activity on the date Dependent Life Insurance or an increase in Dependent Life Insurance Scheduled Benefit due to a change in the Member's Annual Compensation or insurance class would otherwise be effective, such insurance or increase will not be in force for that Dependent spouse until the Period of Limited Activity ends. However, this Period of Limited Activity requirement may be waived as described below. When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy, the Period of Limited Activity requirement may be waived for those Dependent spouses' who: (1) are eligible and enrolled under this Group Policy on its Date of Issue; and (2) were covered under the Prior Policy on the date of its termination. In no event will the Period of Limited Activity requirement be waived for those Dependent spouses' who, on the date of termination of the Prior Policy had the option, under the terms of the Prior Policy, to convert their coverage, under the Prior Policy, to an individual policy. NOTE: When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy and the Period of Limited Activity requirement is waived, any benefits payable will be the lesser of the Scheduled Benefit of this Group Policy or the amount that would have been paid by the Prior Policy had it remained in force. c. If insurance is requested under this Group Policy for a Dependent spouse that was eligible under the Prior Policy, but elected to waive coverage under the Prior Policy. d. If a Dependent is confined in a Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility on the date an increase in the Dependent Life Insurance Scheduled Benefit would otherwise be effective, the Scheduled Benefit in force for the Dependent will continue to apply to the Dependent until such confinement ends. When the Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility confinement ends, the Scheduled Benefit increase will then be in force for the Dependent. e. Any required Proof of Good Health will be with respect to the health of the Member's Dependents. f. If Dependent Life Insurance is in force for a Dependent of the Member, a Member will be insured with respect to a new Dependent (other than a newborn child) on the date the new Dependent is acquired, provided the new Dependent is not then confined in a Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility.
