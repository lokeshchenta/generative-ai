# Semantic Spotter Project: Insurance Agent â€“ RAG on Insurance Data using LlamaIndex

The objective of this project is to develop an efficient Generative Search system for the insurance domain.
We will develop a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based Agent to assist the user in their search.
A RAG system can be implemented in several ways, such as using existing libraries with a custom approach or utilizing frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex that simplify the process of building RAG systems. 
The current implementation utilizes LlamaIndex due to its emphasis on search and retrieval.
